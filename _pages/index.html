  <h1>Why/What</h1>

  <p>
    We are going to vist Europa. Europa is one of Jupiters moons. It has an icy surface with water underneath it. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We decided to explore Europa because it has plenty of water and possible unique minerals and with those, 
    it is possible that life exists on europa. 
    And if life does exist on Europa then maybe we could earn years of scientific knowledge off the discovery. 
    Space exploration could be vital to human development and collecting mineral samples could be helpful.
  </p>
  
  
  
  
  
    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>Rover Design</h2>

    <p>The rover has a design that includes an drill, camera, and a smaller aquatic drone</p>

    <p>
        It also has a sample analyzer to check for life
    </p>

        </iframe> 
    </div>

    <h2 id="aquaticdrone">Aquatic Drone</h2>

    <p>
        The aquatic drone is small so it can fir in with the ice drill on the rover
    </p>
    <p>
        It also has a sample collector that can bring samples back to the rover
    </p>

    <div class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper"> 
        <iframe title="Aquatic Drone" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"

        </iframe> 
    </div>

    <h2 id="icedrill">Ice Drill</h2>
    
    <p>
        The ice drill can drill through the thick ice on Europa
    </p>
    <p>
        It is designed to fit on the back of the rover.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can also deploy the smaller aquatic drone
    </p>

  <h1>Inspiration</h1>

  <p>
    Our inspiration is to get a lot of knowledge of possible things on Europa like unique minerals and possible life. 
    With those things we might increase the scientific knowledge on earth by a lot. And also maybe bring more into the economy 
    by bringing plenty of new minerals in.
    We could also learn more about space from the minerals. We could learn how radiation effects certain minerals 
  </p>

  <p>
    We also got inspired from an on going mission to Europa, the Europa Clipper. The Europa Clipper was launched on October 18, 2024 and will arrive April 2030.
  </p>

  <h1>
    Solving Problems
  </h1>

  <p>
    The Europa expedition team has solutions to many problems like: the water rover runs out of power, 
    So it activates its turbines, lets water flow through them and the water flowing through it generates electricity.
    The all of the rovers power sources are a gram of plutonium just like the mars rover curiosity,
    This lets the rover have virtually unlimited power. Many problems require problem solving to solve, 
    so if any problems happen to occur that the AI can't solve it can change from AI control to 
    Manual, human control (the humans are safely on earth) this can be done with all the tech on the mission (ship, rover, water rover)

  <h1>Funding</h1>

  <h2>We Choose Goverment Funding</h2>

  <p>
    We would rather choose government funding because we want to have more money and private would not be the best, 
    Because it would keep a secret from the people and that could lead to angry people. 
    But also we want government funding because it will supply us with all the technology we need to explore Europa.

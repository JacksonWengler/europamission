    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>Rover Design</h2>

    <p>The rover has a design that includes an drill, camera, and a smaller aquatic drone</p>

    <p>
        It also has a sample analyzer to check for life
    </p>

    <h2 id="aquaticdrone">Aquatic Drone</h2>

    <p>
        The aquatic drone is small so it can fir in with the ice drill on the rover
    </p>
    <p>
        It also has a sample collector that can bring samples back to the rover
    </p>

    <h2 id="icedrill">Ice Drill</h2>
    
    <p>
        The ice drill can drill through the thick ice on Europa
    </p>
    <p>
        It is designed to fit on the back of the rover.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can also deploy the smaller aquatic drone
    </p>

  <h1>Inspiration</h1>

  <p>
    Our inspiration is to get a lot of knowledge off possible things on Europa like unique minerals 
    and possible life with those things we might increase the scientific knowledge earth by a lots

    <h1>Why</h1>

    <p>
      We decided to explore Europa because it has plenty of water and possible unique minerals and with those,
       it is possible that life exists on europa. 
       And if life does exist on Europa then maybe we could earn years of scientific knowledge off the discovery.

    <h1>Funding</h1>

    <h2>We Choose Goverment Funding</h2>

    <p>
      We would rather choose government funding because we want to have more money and private would not be the best, 
      Because it would keep a secret from the people and that could lead to angry people. 
      But also we want government funding because it will supply us with all the technology we need to explore Europa.
